Repair the system as is to use the Lucene indexer.
I am a bit suss as to using Lucene as a document database. I might use Mongo instead.

- move security to config, do not source control
- store documents in mongo
- rebuild front end in Angular vX whatver the latest is
- index with lucene
- add new features, search, fix security etc
- fix lucene indexer to be more configurable, espc. index defn, analysers etc (copy sitecore)
- fix lucene indexer to expose sensible search features
